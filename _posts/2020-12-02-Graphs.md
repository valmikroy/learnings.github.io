### Depth First Search



Algorithm 

- DFS function which loops through adjecency list.
  Runtime complexity is equal to number of vertices 

$$
O(V)
$$

- Explore function which recurse through all the neighbours of each node for its depth.
  Runtime complexity is 
  $$
  \sum_{i\in V} \bigtriangleup_i = 2|E| = O(E)
  $$

  Combining above runtime complexities brings us 
  $$
  O(V+E)
  $$
  

- `seen[]` is an array keeps a track of all the seen elements. 
  $$
  O(V)
  $$
  

- `stack[]` is an array keeps a track of nodes while going in the depth through recursion in the visited order.  
  $$
  O(V)
  $$
  

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'pp'
adjList = {
   1 => [ 2, 5 ],
   2 => [ 1, 4 ],
   4 => [ 5, 2, 7, 8 ],
   5 => [ 1, 4 ],
   7 => [ 4, 8 ], 
   8 => [ 7, 4 ]
}


# DFS function takes the adjList as an argument
def dfs(list)    
		# It initiates two necessary data structures
    # - seen[] which keeps a track of already visited nodes
    # - stack[] keeps a track of vertical path of the explore()'s recursion  
    seen = []
    list.each do |k,v|
        next if seen.include?(k)
        stack = []
      
        # trigger explore for each node
        explore(k,list,seen,stack)
      
        # print the stack of connectiveness of the nodes
        pp stack
    end

end



# exploration function
# takes following as an argument 
# - node
# - adjList
# - seen and stack, which were initialized from the top level
def explore(n,list,seen,stack)
    
    # add it on the seen list
    seen.append(n) 
  
    # add it on the stack
    stack.append(n)
    
  # iterate through each neighbour of the node and trigger explore on them
    neigh = list[n] 
    neigh.each do |nn|
        explore(nn,list,seen,stack) unless seen.include?(nn)
    end
    
    # return stack of all the nodes which got touched through this exploration
    return stack
end

dfs(adjList)
```



### Breadth First Search

Algorithm

- This usually get used to find a shortest distance between two nodes.



```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'pp'
adjList = {
   1 => [ 2, 3 ],
   2 => [ 3, 4 ],
   3 => [ 2, 4, 5 ], 
   4 => [ 3, 6, 7 ],
   5 => [ 3, 6, 8 ],
   6 => [ 5, 4, 9], 
   7 => [ 4, 9, 10 ], 
   8 => [ 5, 9, 11 ],
   9 => [ 6, 7, 8 ],
   10 => [ 7 ],
   11 => [ 8 ]
}

# Structure for the linkedlist
class Node
    attr_accessor :prev, :val
    def initialize(v)
      self.val = v
      self.prev = nil    
    end
end



start = 1
target = 8

# LinkedList traversal function
def buildpath(ll)
  stack = []  
    
    while(ll)
        stack.unshift(ll.val)
        prev = ll.prev
        ll = prev
    end

    return stack
end


# Breadth First Search - it takes start and end nodes as an argument.
def bfs(start,target,adjList)
  
    # To keep a track of already visited nodes
    seen = []
  
    # To keep a track of closest neigbours - FIFO queue
    queue = []
    
  
    # convert node into LL object
    queue.push(Node.new(start))

  
    # Continue till queue is empty 
    while(queue.length != 0) do

        # Take node out of the queue
        n = queue.shift

        # If seen then skip the nodes
        if seen.include?(n.val)
           next 
        else
          	# otherwise register it in the seen before processing
            seen.push(n.val)
        end

        # if we reached to the end node then print the entire path
        if n.val == target
            pp buildpath(n)
            break
        end

        # loop through each neighbour and 
        # push them on the queue for next iteration
        adjList[n.val].each do |nn|
            unless seen.include?(nn)
              
                # form LL strucutre before pushing on the queue
                newnode = Node.new(nn) 
                newnode.prev = n
                queue.push(newnode) 
            end    
        end

    end    
end 

bfs(start, target, adjList)
    
```
