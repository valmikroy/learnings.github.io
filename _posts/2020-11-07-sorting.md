This page to capture basic sorting algorithms which I understood so far.



### Bubble sort

This is sorting by comparing adjecent elements. Here is digramatic representation of this sort  (image credit to [raderson112358](https://randerson112358.medium.com/sorting-algorithms-6005e9ddd8c0))

![bubble sort](https://github.com/valmikroy/learnings.github.io/blob/master/_posts/images/2020-11-07-sorting/bubble_sort.gif?raw=true)

Simple ruby code can be written as following 

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

a = [ 121, 3432, 45, 5, 23 ]

# while swapping two elements set this flag
# this will allow us to detect final iteration which
# goes without swapping to end our compare loop
swap = false

idx = 0

max_len = a.length 


loop do 
    
    # when there is no next element to compare
    if idx == max_len - 1
      # check swap flag to break the loop
      break unless swap  
      
      # reset the swap flag for the next iteration
      swap = false  
      
      # reset the array pointer 
      idx = 0  
      
      # begin next iteration of comparison
      next  
    end

    # swap elements after comparing
    if a[idx]  > a[idx+1]  
      tmp = a[idx+1]  
      a[idx+1] = a[idx] 
      a[idx]  = tmp
      
      # setup a flag to indicate that swapping occurred 
      swap = true
    end

    idx += 1
end
    

puts a
```
