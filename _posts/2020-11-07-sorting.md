This page to capture basic sorting algorithms which I understood so far.



### Bubble sort

This is sorting by comparing adjecent elements. Here is digramatic representation of this sort  (image credit to [raderson112358](https://randerson112358.medium.com/sorting-algorithms-6005e9ddd8c0))

![bubble sort](https://github.com/valmikroy/learnings.github.io/blob/master/_posts/images/2020-11-07-sorting/bubble_sort.gif?raw=true)

Simple ruby code can be written as following 

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

a = [ 121, 3432, 45, 5, 23 ]

# while swapping two elements set this flag
# this will allow us to detect final iteration which
# goes without swapping to end our compare loop
swap = false

idx = 0

max_len = a.length 


loop do 
    
    # when there is no next element to compare
    if idx == max_len - 1
      # check swap flag to break the loop
      break unless swap  
      
      # reset the swap flag for the next iteration
      swap = false  
      
      # reset the array pointer 
      idx = 0  
      
      # begin next iteration of comparison
      next  
    end

    # swap elements after comparing
    if a[idx]  > a[idx+1]  
      tmp = a[idx+1]  
      a[idx+1] = a[idx] 
      a[idx]  = tmp
      
      # setup a flag to indicate that swapping occurred 
      swap = true
    end

    idx += 1
end
    

puts a
```



Various complexities 

```
Worst complexity: n²

Average complexity: n²

Best complexity: n

Space complexity: 1

Method: Exchanging

Stable: Yes

Class: Comparison sort
```





### Merge sort



![Image for post](/Users/abhsawan/git/learnings.github.io/_posts/images/2020-11-07-sorting/merge_sort.png)

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'pp'
a = [38,27,27,43,3,9,82,10]


def mergesort(a)
   
   # return single element array as is
   if a.length == 1
        return a
   # compare and return if array has two elements  
   elsif a.length == 2
    return [ a[1], a[0] ]  if a[0] > a[1]   
    return a
     
   # if array more than 2 
   # then split the array in half
   # trigger recursion for each half  
   else
    len = a.length
    slice = len/2 
    b = mergesort(a[0,slice])   
    c = mergesort(a[slice,len-slice])   
    
    # merge two sorted fragments 
    return merge(b,c)
   end 

end

# Merge function
def merge(a,b)
  
    # index for each fragment
    i=0
    j=0

    out = []
  
    loop do

      # break if both fragments has been traversed 
      break if i == a.length && j == b.length

      # if one fragment is empty then push other fragment
      if i == a.length
        out.push(b[j])
        j += 1
      elsif j == b.length
        out.push(b[i])
        i += 1
        
      # if fragment is not empty then 
      # compare each index position
      # then update that index only  
      elsif a[i] < b[j]
        out.push(a[i])
        i += 1
      else
        out.push(b[j])
        j += 1
      end


    end
   return out
end

pp mergesort(a)
```
